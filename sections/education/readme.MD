# ðŸŽ“ Education Sections â€“ Manager Guide

This guide explains how our education-related sections work together to build two primary page types:

1. **Course Overview Page** â€“ markets the course to prospective students.
2. **Learning Page** â€“ supports active students as they progress through a course.

Unlike technical READMEs aimed at developers, this document focuses on **how a manager or content strategist** should use these sections and when each is appropriate.
