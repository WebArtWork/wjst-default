# üîç SEO Sections ‚Äì Manager Guide

This guide explains how the SEO-related sections work together to improve search visibility and link previews. Unlike the technical READMEs in each subfolder, this file is written for managers or content strategists who need to know when and why to use each section.

## Overview

| Section | Purpose | Manager tips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Article Schema** (`seo/article-schema`) | Embeds structured data for articles so search engines understand your content. | Keep publish dates, authors, and images accurate for better indexing. |
| **Breadcrumb Schema** (`seo/breadcrumb-schema`) | Defines the page trail that can appear in search results. | Reflect your site structure and keep names short. |
| **FAQ Schema** (`seo/faq-schema`) | Marks up common questions and answers for rich FAQ snippets. | Use only real FAQs and keep answers concise. |
| **Meta Preview** (`seo/meta-preview`) | Shows a mock search result with title, URL, and description. | Review copy before publishing; keep titles under ~60 characters. |
| **OG Preview** (`seo/og-preview`) | Previews how a link will look when shared on social media. | Use images that meet platform requirements (e.g. 1200√ó630). |
| **Product Schema** (`seo/product-schema`) | Adds structured data for product details. | Include price, availability, and brand for e‚Äëcommerce pages. |
| **Structured Data** (`seo/structured-data`) | Generic container for any custom JSON‚ÄëLD. | Use for advanced schemas not covered above. |
