# ðŸ’¬ Feedback Sections â€“ Manager Guide

This guide explains how our feedback and testimonial sections fit together to build trust and credibility on your site.

Unlike the technical READMEs (written for developers), this is focused on **how a manager or content strategist** should think about these sections and when to use each.
