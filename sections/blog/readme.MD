# üìñ Blog Sections ‚Äì Manager Guide

This guide explains how our blog-related sections fit together to create two main page types:

1. **Posts Page (Blog listing / archive)** ‚Äì shows multiple articles at once
2. **Post Page (Single article)** ‚Äì shows one article with all supporting info and navigation

Unlike the technical READMEs (written for developers), this is focused on **how a manager or content strategist** should think about these sections and when to use each.

## **1. Posts Page (Blog Listing / Archive)**

**Purpose:**
This page is the ‚Äúfront door‚Äù to your content. It shows visitors a selection of articles, lets them browse by category, and encourages them to click into individual posts.

**Sections commonly used:**

| Section                            | Why it‚Äôs here                                        | Manager tips                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Categories** (`blog/categories`) | Lets visitors filter or explore topics.              | Keep the number of categories manageable (5‚Äì12). Make sure names are clear and consistent.                             |
| **Post Grid** (`blog/post-grid`)   | Displays multiple posts in a grid format.            | Decide if you want latest-first, most popular, or curated selection. Keep titles and images consistent for brand feel. |
| **Post Card** (`blog/post-card`)   | The building block for individual items in the grid. | Strong images and clear titles drive clicks. Avoid too much text in the excerpt.                                       |

**Optional add-ons:**

-   Feature a **highlighted article** above the grid using a large **Post Card** with more visual impact.
-   Place **Categories** above the grid for quick navigation.

## **2. Post Page (Single Article)**

**Purpose:**
This is where a visitor reads the full article. Everything here should build trust, keep them engaged, and invite them to continue exploring.

**Sections commonly used:**

| Section                                  | Why it‚Äôs here                                            | Manager tips                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Meta** (`blog/meta`)                   | Shows date, author, read time, categories.               | Always show date for transparency; use ‚Äúread time‚Äù to set expectations. |
| **Author** (`blog/author`)               | Adds human credibility by showing who wrote it.          | Use a real photo and short, relevant bio.                               |
| **Comments** (`blog/comments`)           | Allows reader interaction.                               | Only enable if you have a moderation process.                           |
| **Related Posts** (`blog/related-posts`) | Keeps readers on the site by suggesting similar content. | Link to posts from the same category or theme.                          |

**Optional add-ons:**

-   Place **Categories** here as clickable tags in Meta.
-   Add a **Post Grid** or **Post Cards** inside the article for promotional content.
