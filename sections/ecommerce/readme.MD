# üõçÔ∏è E-commerce Sections ‚Äì Manager Guide

This guide explains how our ecommerce-related sections fit together to create two main page types:

1. **Catalog Page (Product Listing)** ‚Äì shows multiple products at once
2. **Product Page (Single Product)** ‚Äì shows one product with detailed info and actions

Unlike technical READMEs, this is written for **managers or content strategists** who plan how pages should be assembled.
