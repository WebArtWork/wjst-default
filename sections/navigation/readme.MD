# üß≠ Navigation Sections ‚Äì Manager Guide

This guide explains how our navigation-related sections work together to help visitors move around your site. It is written for managers and content strategists, not developers.

We group navigation into four types:

1. **Global Navigation** ‚Äì appears on every page and points to top-level areas.
2. **Contextual Navigation** ‚Äì shows a visitor where they are or lets them dive deeper in a section.
3. **In‚ÄëPage Navigation** ‚Äì helps users jump within a long page.
4. **Sequential Navigation** ‚Äì moves visitors through lists or multi-page content.

## 1. Global Navigation

**Purpose:** Orient visitors and expose the main areas of the site.

**Sections commonly used:**

| Section                         | Why it‚Äôs here                                      | Manager tips |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Navbar** (`navigation/navbar`) | Standard top navigation with logo and menu items.   | Keep labels short; stick to 5‚Äì7 items for clarity. |
| **Mega Menu** (`navigation/mega-menu`) | Expands the navbar to show grouped links or promos. | Use for complex sites; ensure groups are clearly labeled. |

## 2. Contextual Navigation

**Purpose:** Show location and provide lateral navigation within a section.

**Sections commonly used:**

| Section                              | Why it‚Äôs here                                           | Manager tips |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Breadcrumbs** (`navigation/breadcrumbs`) | Displays the path back to higher-level pages.            | Use on deeper pages so visitors can quickly jump up levels. |

## 3. In‚ÄëPage Navigation

**Purpose:** Let visitors jump to specific parts of a long page.

**Sections commonly used:**

| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Anchor Links** (`navigation/anchor-links`) | Simple list of links to sections on the current page.    | Use sparingly; keep link text short. |
| **Table of Contents** (`navigation/table-of-contents`) | Structured list mirroring page headings.                 | Generate automatically to stay in sync with page content. |
| **Scroll to Top** (`navigation/scroll-to-top`) | Button that returns the visitor to the top of the page. | Only show after the user scrolls; ensure it doesn‚Äôt block content. |

## 4. Sequential Navigation

**Purpose:** Move visitors forward and backward through a list of items or paginated content.

**Sections commonly used:**

| Section                          | Why it‚Äôs here                                        | Manager tips |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Pagination** (`navigation/pagination`) | Lets visitors move through multi-page lists or posts. | Show clear ‚ÄúNext‚Äù and ‚ÄúPrevious‚Äù labels; indicate current page. |
