# üìù Forms Sections ‚Äì Manager Guide

This guide explains how the form-related sections can be combined to capture information from visitors.
Unlike technical READMEs, it focuses on how a manager or content strategist should choose and use each section.

## **Common Form Types**

| Section (`forms/...`) | Purpose | Manager tips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Contact** (`forms/contact`) | Simple way for visitors to get in touch. | Keep fields minimal to boost submissions. |
| **Newsletter** (`forms/newsletter`) | Collect emails for updates or promotions. | Pair with a clear value proposition and follow up with confirmation. |
| **RSVP** (`forms/rsvp`) | Gather event attendance responses. | Ask only essential questions and include event details nearby. |
| **Application** (`forms/application`) | Collect detailed information for programs or jobs. | Consider using **Multistep** if many fields are required. |
| **Survey** (`forms/survey`) | Gather opinions or feedback through questions. | Keep surveys short and consider offering an incentive. |
| **Multistep** (`forms/multistep`) | Break long forms into steps for easier completion. | Provide a progress indicator and allow navigation between steps. |
| **Upload** (`forms/upload`) | Allow users to submit files. | Clarify acceptable file types and size limits. |
